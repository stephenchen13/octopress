I highly recommend reading this ebook published by Aaron Sumner: [Everyday Rails Testing With Rspec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) if you're trying to break into the world of TDD. I've made it through half the book and here are my thoughts so far: the code is clear, the concepts are easy to follow and Aaron provides great insight into the decisions he has made while practicing TDD (i.e. he removes view specs because they are hard to maintain, and he uses integration tests to test things UI-related).
