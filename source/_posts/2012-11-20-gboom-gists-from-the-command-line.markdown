Created my first gem today! And I'm wayyyy too proud of myself right now.

GBOOM is a gem that let's you create gists from your command line. The most useful (read: only) feature that I implemented is that you can pass in specific lines from a file that you want to create a gist from.

I'll write a post in the future about setting up a command line app with GLI and creating a gem but before now just check this shit out!
